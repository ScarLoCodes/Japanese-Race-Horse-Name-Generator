# Japanese-Race-Horse-Name-Generator
A simple HTML page that generates names in the style of Japanese Race Horses.

Instructions:
- Click "Generate Names" to create a list of potential names. By default, it will create 10 names.
- The setting button will open the settings menu. Here, you can change the number of names it will generate.
- The names are organized into two parts. A first part and second part. If you see part of a name you like, you can add it to the First Name Override or Second Name Override text boxes so that the generator will always include it!
- If you'd like to include multiple name ideas for the generator to use, separate them with commas in the override boxes like this: Ship, Teio, Urara.
